title: Hive Public Content API
description: Complete guide to integrating Hive content into your website, landing page, or newsletter
---

This handoff guide is meant for people who simply want to pull live Hive content onto a website, landing page, or newsletter. Everything runs against the production host `https://api.hivecms.online`, and every request uses your workspace's public API key.

## Base URL

All API requests are made to:

```
https://api.hivecms.online/api/public/v1
```

> **Note**: The API is versioned. `v1` is the current stable version. Both `/v1/` and the legacy format (without version) are supported for backward compatibility, but using `/v1/` explicitly is recommended.

## Authentication

Replace `{API_KEY}` in each URL with the key provided to you (or you can issue one from your workspace). Keep it private—even though it's read-only, it maps directly to your workspace.

## Headers

None required. The public API is configured for simple GET requests, so you can call it straight from the browser or curl without setting anything special.

## What's Next?
