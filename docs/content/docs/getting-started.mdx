## Base URL

All API requests are made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.hivecms.online/api/public/v1
```

## API Versioning

The Hive Public Content API is versioned. `v1` is the current stable version. The version should be included in the URL path immediately after `/api/public`.

**Supported URL formats:**
- **Recommended**: `https://api.hivecms.online/api/public/v1/{API_KEY}/posts`
- **Legacy (auto-routes to v1)**: `https://api.hivecms.online/api/public/{API_KEY}/posts`

We recommend using the explicit `/v1/` format for clarity, as future API versions will be maintained separately.

## Authentication

The Hive Public Content API uses API key authentication. Your API key is included directly in the URL path.

### Getting Your API Key

You can obtain your API key from your Hive workspace. The key is read-only and maps directly to your workspace, so keep it private.

### Using Your API Key

Replace `{API_KEY}` in each endpoint URL with your actual API key. For example:

```bash
# Before
https://api.hivecms.online/api/public/v1/{API_KEY}/posts

# After (with your actual key)
https://api.hivecms.online/api/public/v1/your-actual-key-here/posts
```

## Making Requests

The public API is configured for simple GET requests. No special headers are required, so you can call it directly from:

- **Browser**: Use `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest`
- **cURL**: Use the command line examples provided in each endpoint
- **Any HTTP client**: Standard GET requests work out of the box

### Example Request

Here's a simple example using cURL:

```bash
curl "https://api.hivecms.online/api/public/{API_KEY}/posts?limit=5"
```

Or using JavaScript in the browser:

```js
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.hivecms.online/api/public/{API_KEY}/posts?limit=5'
);
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

## Response Format

All successful responses return JSON data. Error responses also use JSON with a `message` field describing the issue.

### Success Response

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "total": 42,
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 10
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "message": "Invalid API key"
}
```
