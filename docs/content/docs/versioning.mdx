description: Understanding Hive Public API versions and migration paths

## Overview

The Hive Public Content API uses semantic versioning to ensure stability and allow for improvements over time. This guide explains our versioning strategy and how it affects your integration.

## Current Version

**v1** is the current stable version of the Hive Public API. All endpoints are available under `/api/public/v1`.

## URL Format

The version is included in the URL path:

```
https://api.hivecms.online/api/public/{VERSION}/{API_KEY}/{ENDPOINT}
```

### Example

```bash
# Versioned URL (recommended)
curl "https://api.hivecms.online/api/public/v1/{API_KEY}/posts"

# Legacy URL (also works, auto-routes to v1)
curl "https://api.hivecms.online/api/public/{API_KEY}/posts"
```

## Backward Compatibility

- **New endpoints** and **additive changes** (new optional fields) are always backward compatible
- **Breaking changes** (removed fields, changed behavior, new required parameters) trigger a new major version
- Both versions coexist simultaneously during a transition period

## Deprecation Policy

When a major version is deprecated, we follow this timeline:

1. **Announcement Phase**: You'll receive notification and documentation about what changed
2. **Deprecation Phase** (typically 1-3 months):
   - Old version continues to work
   - Requests to old version return deprecation headers:
     - `Deprecation: true`
     - `Sunset: <date>` (when support ends)
     - `X-API-Suggest: <new-version>`
3. **Sunset Phase**: The old version stops working and returns `410 Gone`

## What Triggers a New Version?

A new version is created for:

- **Field removals**: Endpoints no longer return a field
- **Field renames**: Field names change (different JSON keys)
- **Behavior changes**: Endpoint logic or filtering changes
- **New required parameters**: Query parameters become required
- **Response structure changes**: Envelope or layout changes
- **Endpoint removals**: An endpoint is no longer available

New versions are NOT created for:

- New optional fields added to responses
- New optional query parameters
- Performance improvements
- Bug fixes that correct behavior

## Migration Guide: v1 → v2 (Future)

When v2 is released, this section will document:
- What changed from v1 to v2
- Step-by-step migration instructions
- Code examples showing before/after
- Sunset date for v1

Until then, v1 is stable and will not change in breaking ways.

## Best Practices

1. **Use explicit version in URLs**: Always use `/v1/` instead of relying on the legacy fallback
2. **Monitor deprecation headers**: Parse response headers for `Deprecation` and `Sunset` warnings
3. **Plan migrations early**: When a deprecation is announced, schedule time to migrate
4. **Test against new versions**: When available, test your integration against new versions before sunset
