- all the route pages would be put here, for example look at the Home.tsx and
  how it is used in main.tsx to map to a route

  pages, avoid directly writing any business logic in pages
- for toasts, we are using a library named sonner (refer to it's docs whenever
  needed from [here](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/))
